# Write a method that takes a String as an argument, and returns a new String that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization scheme in which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining characters are lowercase. Characters that are not letters should not be changed, but count as characters when switching between upper and lowercase.

def staggered_case(string)
  staggered = []
  string.chars.each_with_index do |char, index|
    if index.even?
      staggered << char.upcase
    elsif index.odd?
      staggered << char.downcase
    end
  end
  staggered.join
end
