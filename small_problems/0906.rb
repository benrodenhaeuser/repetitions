# Write a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns an Array that contains every word from the string, to which you have appended a space and the word length.

# You may assume that words in the string are separated by exactly one space, and that any substring of non-space characters is a word.


=begin

- split the sentence into array of words (i.e., split along whitespace)
- map the array of words to pairs [word, word.length]
- map that array again, joining the pairs with whitespace

  pairs = sentence.split.map { |word| [word, word.length] }
  pairs.map { |pair| pair.join(' ') }
